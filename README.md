# Unsupervised Machine Learning Project
This is a short project that using sklearn to cluster cyptocurrency % changes based on how they move over 24 hours and over 7 days. It also uses PCA to compress and cluster data


## Features

- Using scikit learn to determine the best # of clusters to represent data (k) 
- Makes a scatterplot of datapoints with different colors to represent clusters in the data, based on 24h movement and 7 day movement
- Uses Principal Component Analysis to summarize and cluster data, and graph the clusters as well

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- Any text editor compatable with ipynb files

Required libraries to pip install:

- pandas

- hvplot

- sklearn


## Usage

Ensure all required libaries are pip installed

Ensure "crypto_market_data.csv" is in the "Resources" folder

Ensure the "Resources" folder is in the same folder as "Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb"

Open "Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb" with a text editor compatable with IYPNB files

Click "Run All" and allow the code to run

Ensure all graphs and dataframes populate properly
