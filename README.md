# Unsupervised Machine Learning Project
This is a short project that using sklearn to cluster cypto currency % changes based on how they move over 24 hours and over 7 days. It also uses PCA to 
## Features

- Using scikit learn to determine the best # of clusters to represent data (k) 
- Makes a scatterplot of datapoints with different colors to represent clusters in the data, based on 24h movement and 7 day movement
- Uses Principal Component Analysis to summarize and cluster data, and graph the clusters as well
